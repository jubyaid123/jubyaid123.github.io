                <h2>Hello, I'm Jubyaid</h2>
                <p> A skilled problem solver, and passionate computer science enthusiast. I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree at The City College of New York, graduating in June 2025. Proficient in languages like C++, Java, Python, and more, I've also earned certifications in C++ programming and data structures.
                Through my studies and research internship, I have developed a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications. Currently a Software Development Fellow at CUNY Tech Prep, I'm diving into web development with React, Node + Express, and PostgreSQL.</p>
